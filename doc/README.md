Vertcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Vertcoin Core is based on Botcoin COre, the original Bitcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Vertcoin transactions, which requires a few gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from an hour to a day or more.

To download Vertcoin Core, visit [vertcoin.org](https://vertcoin.org/download-wallet/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Vertcoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/vertcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/vertcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run vertcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Vertcoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Vertcoin Core.

### Need Help?

Since Vertcoin is forked from Bitcoin, most technical questions can be answered using the Bitcoin Help resources listed below.

However, for Vertcoin specific issues, ask for help on the [Vertcoin Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/vertcoin)

Bitcoin help and documentation can be found at the following links:

* See the documentation at the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page)
for help and more information.
* Ask for help on [#bitcoin](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=bitcoin) on Freenode. If you don't have an IRC client, use [webchat here](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=bitcoin).
* Ask for help on the [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) forums, in the [Technical Support board](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0).
